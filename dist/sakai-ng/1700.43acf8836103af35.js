Nevertheless, livestock contribute 14% of the total annual anthropogenic greenhouse (GHG) emissions [2]. Pasture for cattle grazing is the dominant agricultural land use in the tropics with almost 80% of forest area cleaned in the Neotropics converted to pasture [3]. Despite tropical forests constitute an ecological biome of global importance to carbon cycles, patters of climate and biodiversity [4] in developing countries are changing rapidly in response to a variety of drivers [5]. Therefore, globally, natural 139 forest and grasslands are declining due to human activities such as deforestation or urbanisation. For this reason, agriculture including land-use change, and deforestation, is a particular focus, because it was responsible for 23% of the total GHG emissions globally in 2017 [6].
